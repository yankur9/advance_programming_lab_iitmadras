Tour to the Good Place
After her death, Miss Eleanor Shellstrop is welcomed to her afterlife in a community called "The Good Place". The
community comprises of a group of N neighbourhoods (1 to 10^3), labeled 1, 2, 3, ...., N and widely distributed.
The travel guide Michael has the power to take travelers from neighbourhood i to neighbourhood 2i (1 <= i <= N/2),
visiting all intermediate neighborhoods. This costs 4 dollars. On the other hand, the guide Shawn has the power to take
travelers from neighbourhood i to neighbourhood i+1 for just 2 dollars.
Miss. Eleanor wants to visit neighbourhoods 1, 2, 3, ...., M (1 <= M <= N). Eleanor can use Michael or Shawn to go from
one neighbourhood to another. Write a program to help Miss Eleanor visit the M neighbourhoods at the lowest cost.
Input Format
1st line contain number of test cases T and the next T lines contains M for each of the T test cases

Explanation 0
8 : 0 -> 1 (S); 1 -> 2 (S) ; 2 -> 4 (M) ; 4 -> 8 (M) . Total cost is 2+2+4+4 = 12
14: 0 -> 1(S); 1 -> 2 (S) ; 2 -> 3 (S) ; 3 -> 6 (M) ; 6 -> 7 (S) ; 7 -> 14 (M) . Total cost is 2+2+2+4+2+4 = 16
Here S is for Shawn and M for Michael
For testcase#1: M = 8, cost to reach neighbourhood 1 is 2(0 -> 1). From neighborhood 1, we can go to neighborhood 2
(1->2) in 2 ways: with Shawn for 2 dollars and with Michael for 4 dollars, as 2 dollars is minimum, we choose Shawn.
From neighborhood 2 we can visit all nodes from 2 to 4 with Michael for 4 dollars or with Shawn for 4(2+2) dollars.
Similarly at 4, we can visit all nodes from 4 to 8 in 4 dollars with Michael or 8(2+2+2+2) dollars with Shawn, we choose
Michael and so on.
